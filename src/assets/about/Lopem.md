# About Me

I'm a 20 year old self-taught developer. I currently work for a Financial technology company as a Full-Stack Developer.
<br>
I mainly focus on the front-end side of the development team, with the goal of recreating Riskflow's legacy system to new modern and user-friendly web standards. All of the work I do is done in Angular 7 and Node.js. I'm constantly  pushing myself to learn new technologies and programming methodologies  to improve the quality of work I produce.
<br>
Other than programming I'm also a hobbyist photographer. Shooting most of my work on an iPhone. All of my work is on Instagram.
