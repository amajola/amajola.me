### Junior Web Developer at Riskflow Technologies
<br>
My main goal is to create and improve the current look and feel of the legacy systems. I create new and friendly user interfaces to make it easier for the end user to get more tasks done without the application interface getting into their way.
<br>
The two primary technologies I use are, Angular 7 and Node.js and Adobe XD for simple user interface prototype
